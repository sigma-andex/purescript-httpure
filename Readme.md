[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigma-andex/purescript-httpurple/main/License)

A functional http framework with a focus on type-safety and simplicity. 

This project was originally forked from the amazing [HTTPure](https://github.com/citizennet/purescript-httpure) http server framework. If you are coming from HTTPure you might want to have a look at the [differences to HTTPure](./docs/Differences.md).

## Quick start

```purescript
module Main where

import Prelude hiding ((/))

import HTTPurple

data Route = Hello String
derive instance Generic Route _

route :: RouteDuplex' Route
route = mkRoute
  { "Hello": "hello" / segment
  }

main :: ServerM
main =
  serve { port: 8080 } { route, router }
  where
  router { route: Hello name } = ok $ "hello " <> name
```

then start the server

```bash
‚ûú spago run
           Src   Lib   All
